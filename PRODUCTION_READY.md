## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API Error"**
- Check your API key in `.env.local`
- Ensure you have OpenAI credits available
- Verify the key starts with `sk-`

**"Failed to scrape URL"**
- Some sites block automated requests
- Try different product URLs
- Check if the URL is accessible

**"Content generation taking too long"**
- OpenAI API can take 5-15 seconds for complex requests
- This is normal for high-quality AI generation
- Fallback systems activate if needed

### Performance Tips
- Set up caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider upgrading OpenAI plan for faster responses
- Use fallback mode during development to save API costs

## 📈 Production Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Any other optional keys
3. Deploy automatically

### Environment Variables for Production
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-production-key

# Optional but recommended
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Database (for analytics)
DATABASE_URL=your-production-database-url
```

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Costs (Approximate)
- **Title Enhancement**: ~$0.001 per request
- **Complete Campaign**: ~$0.005-0.010 per request
- **Market Research**: ~$0.003-0.007 per request

### Monthly Estimates
- **Light Usage** (100 requests): ~$0.50-1.00
- **Moderate Usage** (1,000 requests): ~$5.00-10.00
- **Heavy Usage** (10,000 requests): ~$50-100

## 🔄 Fallback Systems

The software works in three modes:

1. **Full AI Mode**: OpenAI API key provided - all features use real AI
2. **Enhanced Fallback**: No API key - smart fallback data that's still very good
3. **Basic Mode**: Minimal functionality if all systems fail

This ensures your software always works, even during API outages.
